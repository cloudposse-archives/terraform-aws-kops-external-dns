# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision an IAM role for `external-dns` running in a Kops cluster, and attach an IAM policy to the role with permissions to modify Route53 record sets.


  ## Overview

  This module assumes you are running [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns) in a Kops cluster.

  It will provision an IAM role with the required permissions and grant the Kops masters the permission to assume it.

  This is useful to make Kubernetes services discoverable via AWS DNS services.

  The module uses [terraform-aws-kops-metadata](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-metadata) to lookup resources within a Kops cluster for easier integration with Terraform.
